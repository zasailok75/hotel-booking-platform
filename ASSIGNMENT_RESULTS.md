# Hotel Room Booking Platform - Assignment Results

## ✅ Test Case Results

**Both test cases are PASSING successfully!**

### Test Case 1: Simultaneous Booking ✅
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Function**: `book_room(room, check_in_date, check_out_date)`
- **Behavior**: 
  - First booking succeeds and returns a Booking object
  - Second overlapping booking fails and returns `None`
  - Prevents double booking through database-level locking

### Test Case 2: Search by City and Hotel Name ✅
- **Status**: PASSED  
- **Function**: `search_hotels(hotels, city=None, name=None)`
- **Behavior**:
  - Search by city returns 1 result (Goa hotels)
  - Search by name returns 1 result (Oceanview hotels)
  - Case-insensitive matching implemented

## 🚀 Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`booking/test_functions.py`** - Core functions for the test cases
   - `book_room()` - Handles room booking with overlap prevention
   - `search_hotels()` - Searches hotels by city/name
   - `search_hotels_orm()` - Optimized ORM version

2. **`booking/assignment_tests.py`** - Exact test cases from assignment
   - Implements the provided test cases
   - Can be run independently or via management command

3. **`booking/management/commands/run_assignment_tests.py`** - Django command
   - Run with: `python manage.py run_assignment_tests`

4. **`booking/models.py`** - Updated Room model
   - Added `available_from` and `available_to` fields
   - Migration created and applied

### Key Features:

- **Thread-Safe Booking**: Uses `select_for_update()` to prevent race conditions
- **Overlap Detection**: Prevents double booking with date range validation
- **Case-Insensitive Search**: Hotel search works regardless of case
- **Database Transactions**: Atomic operations ensure data consistency
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with `None` return values

## 🧪 Running the Tests

```bash
# Run assignment test cases
python manage.py run_assignment_tests

# Run all Django tests (some existing tests may have issues)
python manage.py test booking.tests
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Booking Logic:
- Uses Django's `@transaction.atomic` decorator
- Implements `select_for_update()` for row-level locking
- Validates date ranges and prevents overlapping bookings
- Returns `None` on failure, `Booking` object on success

### Search Logic:
- Supports both city and name filtering
- Case-insensitive matching with `icontains`
- Works with both list of objects and Django QuerySets
- Optimized for performance with proper indexing

## 📝 Code Comments

The implementation includes comprehensive comments explaining:
- Critical booking logic and race condition prevention
- Search implementation and optimization strategies  
- Error handling and validation approaches
- Database transaction management

## 🎯 Conclusion

**Your code successfully passes both test cases!** The hotel booking platform correctly handles simultaneous bookings and hotel search functionality as required by the assignment.
