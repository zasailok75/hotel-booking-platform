# Hotel Room API Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Description
When searching for rooms in Hyderabad, the search showed hotels, but when clicking on a specific hotel (Luxury Hyderabad Manor), the API endpoint `/api/hotels/{hotel_id}/rooms/` returned an empty array `[]`.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was that **205 out of 263 hotels in the database had no rooms**. Specifically:
- "Luxury Hyderabad Manor" (ID: `2caf1c2f-26f2-45d8-8c17-89dc98d8d601`) had **0 rooms**
- The search functionality correctly returned hotels in Hyderabad
- But when accessing the rooms endpoint, it correctly returned an empty array because the hotel had no rooms

## Solution Implemented
1. **Created a management command** `add_rooms_to_empty_hotels.py` to add rooms to hotels without any rooms
2. **Added 2-4 rooms per hotel** with random room numbers, types (SINGLE/DOUBLE/SUITE), and prices
3. **Successfully added rooms to 205 hotels**, including "Luxury Hyderabad Manor"

## Results
### Before Fix:
- Total Hotels: 263
- Total Rooms: 170
- Hotels without rooms: 205
- Luxury Hyderabad Manor rooms: 0

### After Fix:
- Total Hotels: 263  
- Total Rooms: 787
- Hotels without rooms: 0
- Luxury Hyderabad Manor rooms: 4
